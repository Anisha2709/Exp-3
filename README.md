# Exp - 3 RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To model and automate railway management system operations using UML diagrams in StarUML.

# SRS (Procedure):
### Step 1: Problem Identification
Identify the challenges in manual railway operations, focusing on inefficiencies in ticket booking, scheduling, and passenger management.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Define key user roles (Admin, Clerk, Passenger) and specify core functions such as ticket booking, train scheduling, seat allocation, and report generation.

### Step 3: System Design
Develop UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Package) in StarUML, and design database tables for trains, passengers, bookings, and schedules.
